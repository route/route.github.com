### About me:
I'm [Dmitry Vorotilin](http://github.com/route) and I spend my life in front of
a computer. It's an everyday struggle because I wanna do something useful
outside of it but it's the only thing I can do the best and by the way it gives
me an ability to pay bills and live happily. I'm not looking for any part time
job because I love my current job with all my ❤️. I'm very curious about
programming languages, debugging and bugs. I always learn something new and
don't feel confident in any area because there's always that surprises me.

You can see my commits in

the city, skating, playing football, doing sport and meeting new people.
