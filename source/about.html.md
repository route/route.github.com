### About me:
I'm [Dmitry Vorotilin](http://github.com/route) developer with knowledge of
several programming languages, design patterns, frameworks and many other bold
words that I learnt while coding since 2007. I'm very curious about design and
paradigms of different programming languages. I like debugging and investigating
crime scenes with distressing bugs where everyone scratches their heads. I always
learn something new because there's always something that surprises me.

You can see my commits in
