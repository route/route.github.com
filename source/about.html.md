### About me:
I'm [Dmitry Vorotilin](http://github.com/route) developer with knowledge of several programming languages and various
technologies that I learnt while coding. I convert business tasks to scalable code and infrastructure since 2007. I'm
very curious about design and paradigms of different programming languages. I like debugging and investigating crime
scenes with distressing bugs where everyone scratches their heads. I always try to learn something new reading books
but most skills I've got mainly experimenting on practice. I was working as a system administrator for a couple of
years at the start of my career and since then I've never stopped evolving in this direction adding here modern
methodologies like devops and gitops and things like containers and kubernetes.
