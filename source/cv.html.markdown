### About me:
I'm Dmitry Vorotilin – developer with knowledge of several programming
languages and design patterns, open source contributor, strong team player.
Most of all I love my job, by the way it gives me an ability to live happily.
I'm very curious about bugs and if I find something I'll give a shot to fix it
and send a PR on github (if I have time indeed). You can see my commits in such
projects like Rails, Poltergeist, Capybara, MiniTest and so on. Besides job I
like having fun with friends, cycling around the city, skating, playing football
or doing sport. Meeting new people is another thing I like to do, get in touch:
