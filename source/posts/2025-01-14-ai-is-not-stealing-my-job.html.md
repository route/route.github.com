AI is never going to steal my job. Period. 

there are tasks that you can't google, you have to fit it into your memory, grasp and produce the result. These kind of tasks are ungoogled. 

better code is no code, better ticket is not ticket.

a better engineer before starting to work on the ticket should ask himself, does business need this feature?
